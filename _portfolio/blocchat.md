## Explanation

Bloc Chat is a real-time chat application that uses Firebase to save and display user/message information. The user must first make a username, then they have access to all chat-rooms as well as the ability to create new rooms. 
 

## Problem

Bloc Chat was the first project I built from the ground up. I had also never used a database before which proved to be a challenge. 

## Solution

Using Angular and bootstrap I created the modals/view for username and room creation. Firebase took care of the rest. 

## Results

The result is a pretty neat clean chat app that could be used to stay in contact with friends or with co-workers.


## Conclusion

I really enjoyed this project. Using Firebase was great and made things pretty easy. The hardest part for me was getting the page to display I wanted and required a fair bit of reading on bootstrap.
