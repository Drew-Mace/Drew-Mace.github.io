## Explanation

BlocJams was a project I completed for the front-end portion of my Bloc curriculum. It is a sleek, responsive music player where the user has the ability to view the albums in the collection and play the music using built-in player controls. 
 

## Problem

BlocJams was first built using JavaScript. I was tasked with refactoring it into Angular.

## Solution

The solution was simple. I already had a design and the old JS code, all that was left was to alter the index page so that it displayed the view and set up the angular pages. 

## Results

The result was much cleaner, concise code. It is much easier to manipulate the DOM elements using Angular. It is also much easier to figure out where problems are coming from. Instead of one main .js file, there were multiple files each responsible for specific things - so that when something went wrong I knew exactly where to look. 


## Conclusion

This project proved challenging and I had made quite a few hours that took me some time to figure out. It was very fulfilling when I finally heard the music playing and everything was displaying properly.
