title: Learning at Bloc
---

Before I enrolled at Bloc, I had done a fair bit of research into the other coding boot camps available. I had narrowed down my choice to two options: Thinkful and Bloc. I really liked both of them, and while I think either would have suited me, I chose to go with Bloc because it has a software development track, which is what I ideally want to do. Web development is great, but I want to have a deeper understanding of computer science fundamentals. Also, the year-long curriculum would allow me to work full-time and study at the same time. 

 I am currently on my 10th week at Bloc, and the amount of information I have already learned is staggering. When I started Bloc, I had only previously done a few courses on codeacademy.com to see if this was something I could really sink my teeth into. Now I have built two awesome projects, which you can see on this page under "My work." There were a few times when I felt overwhelmed, but if I couldn't Google my way out of the situation, my mentor was right there to lend a hand. 

Overall, Bloc has been a great experience. I know that doing this will lead me to where I want to be. Everything I have worked on so far hasn't felt like wasted time. I am very excited to continue this journey and become a software developer. 

If you are someone who is thinking about taking the leap and starting a program, and if you are someone who is driven and willing to sift through StackOverflow posts and Google to figure out the problem at hand, then Bloc is for you. I know it's for me.
